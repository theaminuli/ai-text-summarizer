== Description ==

**Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR)?** The most powerful AI summarization plugin for WordPress! This summarizing tool generates instant TL;DR summaries using 6 AI models: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, and Google AI. Add customizable "Summarize" and "Get TL;DR" buttons that can be placed anywhere with automatic insertion capabilities.

**🚀 Boost Your Site's Authority & SEO:** When users engage with your content through TL;DR summaries, it increases time on page, reduces bounce rates, and improves user experience metrics—all signals that AI search engines use to build your site's authority and trustworthiness. Better engagement means higher visibility, making your content more likely to be referenced by AI systems and rank higher in WordPress search results.

**Perfect for:** Bloggers, content creators, news sites, students, researchers, educators, and anyone who wants to make long-form content more accessible with automatic text summarization.

= What is TL;DR and Why It Matters =

**TL;DR** (or TLDR, tl;dr) stands for "Too Long; Didn't Read" - a popular internet acronym that originated in online forums and Usenet newsgroups in the early 2000s. Added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2013, it serves two purposes:

1. **As a response** - Acknowledging that content is too lengthy to read completely
2. **As a label** - Introducing a concise summary of the main points

In today's fast-paced digital world, readers scan before committing time to full articles. **Perfect for long-form content, research articles, blog posts, and documentation, adding TL;DR summaries helps readers quickly identify if your content is worth their time.**

**Why TL;DR Buttons Improve Your Website:**

* **Combat Information Overload** - Help readers quickly grasp key points in seconds
* **Respect Reader Time** - Modern audiences appreciate quick content previews
* **Reduce Bounce Rates** - Engage visitors who might leave without reading
* **Improve Accessibility** - Make lengthy content more navigable and user-friendly
* **Increase Engagement** - Summaries encourage readers to explore full content
* **Boost SEO** - Better user metrics (lower bounce, higher time-on-page) signal quality to search engines
